# WordpressApi

This Magento 2 module is a connector for displaying WordPress content in Magento2. By using the REST API, Magento retrieves data from wordpress regarding pages and posts for display either as a blog, block or widget.

Safely install your WordPress in a completely separate location from your Magento install, provide credentials for connection and you can freely display WP data anywhere in your site.
